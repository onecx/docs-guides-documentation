= Referencing 

This chapter gives guidance on how to reference parts of documentation.

To reference parts of documentation consider using AsciiDoc https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/xref/[*xref macro*]. For internal references, the macro usage is standard.

For referencing resources external to the current documentation, it is required to use the resource ID generated by Antora based on the documentation configuration. For further information, please reference https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/page/xref/.
